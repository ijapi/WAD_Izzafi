            <h2>SeedFund - A Donation App for Forest Restoration</h2>
            <p>SeedFund is a mobile app designed to make donating to forest restoration and community-building projects simple. You can choose trees to donate, which will be planted by the SeedFund team. You can also track the growth of the trees youâ€™ve helped plant, adding a personal touch to your contribution to nature.</p>
            <p>I worked on the tree selection, tree details screens, and donation history, ensuring that users can easily choose which trees to plant or donate and receive detailed information about the growth of their contributions.</p>

            <h2>Tree Selection, Tree Details, Donation History</h2>
            <p>The tree selection part was particularly designed with a focus on user-friendly navigation and visually appealing layouts. Users can browse different species of trees and see detailed descriptions, photos, and the environmental impact of each species. Each tree option includes a visual preview and the option to track growth once a donation has been made.</p>
            <p>The UI design for the tree details screen includes clear buttons, vibrant imagery, and an intuitive layout to make it easy for users to follow the growth and status of their trees.</p>
            <p>The UI design for the donation history includes the total amount you donated, and what trees you've been donated, and more necessary details.</p>
